# SpotLess

## Description

This was begun in my general assembly course. Since then I have extensively edited it, although the functionality remains the same. The app allows you to create playlists which are saved to a database (dynamodb), as well as favorite certain songs. The frontend is built using react functional componenets and deployed to github pages. The gh-pages branch is currently set to private, because I do not want to incur excessive costs to my aws account. Once I create a lambda authorizer that limits the number of api calls from a users ip address, I will make it public.
